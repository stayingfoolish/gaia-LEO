Gaia-LEO, a mixed-integer optimization framework that co-designs orbital and terrestrial data-center networks for the next generation of AI and Earth-observation workloads. The model jointly optimizes facility location, network topology, and workload placement by minimizing total CapEx + OpEx while satisfying real-world physical constraints latency, bandwidth, power, and thermal limits. Each orbital module represents a 40 MW containerized data-center node with solar power and radiative cooling; ground sites anchor fiber backhaul and user access. Using inputs from NASA’s CO2 emissions, water & orbital debris data and web scraped data center placement data the solver decides which orbital clusters to launch, which ground points of presence to activate, and how to route traffic through optical & inter-satellite links.
This framework directly addresses the challenge of commercializing LEO by quantifying when and where orbital compute becomes economically advantageous compared with terrestrial infrastructure. It transforms space from a communications relay into a computational layer – a sustainable, solar-powered extension of Earth’s cloud. The result is an actionable blueprint for scaling AI training and climate modeling in orbit, reducing terrestrial power and water footprints, and accelerating humanity’s transition toward space-based green compute as part of the emerging orbital economy.
